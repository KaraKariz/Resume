    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>I am really enjoying to:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Gaming</b> - Love to play games. I am learning a lot from it and I meet new interesting people while we all have fun together.</li>
        <li><b>Football</b> - European football of course which is the only football. I was playing this sport since i was 4 years old and i kinda put it on back track 3 years ago (I was 27).</li>
        <li><b>Reading</b> - When i was a kid i was reading a lot. Not really hard books, but i was mad on comic books, fictional fantasy gander and most historian war time based books. Some favourites of them are Asterix and Obelix, Lord of the rings and Gengiskhan.</li>
        <li><b>Programming</b> - I always loved to code. Right now i am trying to make this into reality and have a steady job with this. Its such a unique way of expression yourself.</li>
        <li><b>Animals</b> - Its not really a hobbie, but a dream. After i get financial independant i will create a sanctuary for animals on a big ranch and try to help out all animals without homes, give love to old abandoned ones. They deserve better from humas.</li>
